this repo is for openGL homeworks, here is a list of the projects in this repo:

* spongeBob character

## first: solar system
using sphereical coordinates to draw the planets, a certain regime for the coloring, and transformations to obtain the motion of all these elements, I was able to make a solar system, with camere function to move around it.

## second: SpongeBob
this homework witnessed a remarkable development in Camera code (which I stole happily :) ), and the main goal of it is to apply the concepts of texture, here, I used a box class which takes 6 texutres for all 6 faces with documeneted functions, the box accepts internal texturing for cerain cases, I used a function to draw bikini bottom skybox, this exact skybox has been used as a counter strike mod, which I turned into a bmp files and upscaled it with AI, it's an important notice that all texutes must be of 2^n size in pixels, then I used Cylinder class (which ,once again, I stole happily) to draw the arms, legs, sleeves of the shirt, and the short pants, this class accepts texturing and it can draw cones as well, and finally, spongeBob can move freely around the env, when he moves, his legs move too, fps and tps are enabled, u can take a look at all assets and codes in the repo.
